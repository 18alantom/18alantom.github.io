    <p>
      I play for the feels. This is a list of recently played games in rough
      order of how much I liked them.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Outer Wilds</h4>
      <p>
        This game does everything right for me. The puzzle-like narrative that
        makes me want to seek out. The soundtrack that catapults me back to the
        same sense of melancholic wonder. Setting and themes that nerd-sniped me
        in the first thirty minutes. The opening scene you don't realize until
        much later.
        <button
          data-content="Purposely vague to avoid being even in the vicinity of spoilers"
        >
          Everything</button
        >!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>What Remains of Edith Finch</h4>
      <p>
        Aims an arrow full of pathos and takes a shot at your heart. It's not a
        sad game but evokes a deep sense of sadness. It makes you sit down and
        contemplate the mortality of everyone you hold dear. A three-hour long
        play that stays with you.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Disco Elysium</h4>
      <p>
        There are few games in this list that somehow manage to excel in all
        aspects; this is one of them. I think what sets this game apart is the

        <button
          data-content="It isn't “alternate” in overly conspicuous ways, but it
          has it's own detailed theories and physical reality that you realize
          as the game progresses"
        >
          alternate
        </button>
        reality that is crafted into it. The game has incredible depth but never
        to the point of being tedious. And this depth is detailed by its music,
        voice acting, art style, and characters—it builds a world you steep in.
        Probably one of the few games I'll replay.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Red Dead Redemption 2</h4>
      <p>
        Unparalleled freedom that makes you strongly consider being an outlaw in
        the 1800s. That being said, the vastness of this game is double-edged.
        When you start, the novelty quotient is incredibly high. You want to
        interact with everything the game offers. But as the end nears, the
        vastness grows a bit stale. Nevertheless, it is a game everyone should
        start—the story,
        <button data-content="You grow attached because of how real they feel">
          character
        </button>
        building, depth of interaction, and ending make it one of the best games
        I've ever played.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Return of the Obra Dinn</h4>
      <p>
        I started playing this because I was highly intrigued by its 1 bit
        dithered art style. It took me a few hours of gameplay to get a hang of
        the partial knowledge puzzles. After that, the game draws you in deeper,
        and makes you feel smart for figuring it out. And the story gets
        increasingly fantastical as you piece it together. An incredibly
        satisfying game to solve.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Sally Face</h4>
      <p>
        A strange juxtaposition of dark and wholesome that works. The character
        of Sally Face—in some inexplicable manner—resonated with me. Even though
        the writing felt a bit naive at times, the artwork,
        <button
          data-content="It has one of my favorite chip-tunes of all time!"
        >
          music</button
        >, and themes are what I'll remember it for.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Half-Life</h4>
      <p>
        This game is from 1998; I played it in 2025 out of curiosity. I thought
        I'd play for an hour or two and go, "Huh cute, so that's how it was back
        then" and then forget about it. I was plenty wrong. I still don't get
        how this game has so much depth and is so much
        <button
          data-content="Gonarch's sound effects are so
        cool!"
        >
          fun</button
        >! Triangle count doesn't matter; this game will forever hold up.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Subnautica</h4>
      <p>
        <em>
          I just need one magnetite for the mod station; should be a quick
          five-minute trip to the Jellyshroom Cave, then I'll go sleep.
        </em>
        That doesn't happen. You instead find enough magnetite to
        <em>almost</em> finish four other things. So you decide to spend
        <em>five more</em>
        minutes finishing those, and this recurses until your initial five
        minutes have bloomed into five hours. Addictive aspect of survival craft
        aside, this game too makes you want to seek out. Find things and go
        deeper, and it
        <button data-content="In what way, you'll have to play to find out">
          rewards
        </button>
        you appropriately for doing so.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Metro 2033</h4>
      <p>
        The metro is a scary place. This is probably the most linear game in
        this list, but that doesn't take away from the experience. The
        atmosphere in this and Last Light has a very sepulchral vibe going on.
        You think the metro is bad, but then you go on top and realize they're
        cloistered in there for a reason.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Metro Last Light</h4>
      <p>
        My favorite out of the three Metros. It has everything the first game
        has but in more detail. The story line continues. This, along with the
        first game, play a pretty solid story.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>God of War</h4>
      <p>
        This is an obviously fantastic game in most aspects—voice acting, story,
        characters, and gameplay. The only reason it's lower is because the
        story felt like a prelude, and the primary antagonist didn't feel
        compelling
        <button
          data-content="It isn't particularly difficult to whoop his ass when
          the time comes to do so."
        >
          enough</button
        >. From what I've been told, the game is more gratifying if you're the
        completionist
        <button
          data-content="like completing the trials and the various gauntlets"
        >
          type</button
        >.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Prey (2017)</h4>
      <p>
        The game allows for many ways to get something done, but there are a
        couple of very obvious ways to do them. So unless you're going out of
        your way to experiment, you'll find no need for a lot of the
        <button
          data-content="I think the contra here is that, that is the point of
          the gameplay. You pick a style that suits you and you go with it, and
          what's obvious to you won't be obvious to another, so there tends to
          be high variation in people's experience of the game"
        >
          mechanics</button
        >. While the gameplay and interactive environment take center stage, I
        feel the story and setting are deeply compelling and would make the game
        stand irrespective of the gameplay.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Metro Exodus</h4>
      <p>
        This Metro has the best gameplay out of the three. But, strangely, some
        aspects of the first two Metros are absent. Because of this, the
        characteristic charm of a Metro game is lessened. It ends up feeling
        more like a spin-off than a sequel.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>The Talos Principle</h4>
      <p>
        Completing the puzzles this game has is satisfying, but—perhaps cause I
        didn't pay enough attention—the philosophy and story in it did not click
        with me. Even then, I found the ending to be quite mind-blowing.
      </p>
    </div>

      Racing is another genre I
      <button
        data-content="Track Mania Nations and Gran Tursimo 4 being all time
        favorites. I also like BeamNG, mainly to witness the physics. For
        whatever reason I find it almost impossible to play—as in actually
        race—with a controller."
      >
        enjoy</button
      >, but I try not to indulge cause the need to improve lap times takes
      over, and then it becomes hard to put down. Same with others that have an
      aspect of endless betterment—fighting games, Kerbal Space Program, etc.
      They are a lot of fun, but I could play them forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, I almost exclusively play single-player games, ones that have a
      story to tell. Because they end, but their stories remain.
