    <p>
      Please excuse the self-indulgence. I have been around for quite a while
      now, but all this time I've spent being around, it felt like there's been
      something cramping my expression. As though I've been interfacing with the
      world through a knotted hose, only a trickle of what I meant to express
      ever got through.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an imperfect analogy cause even the trickle that gets through is
      often misunderstood. So here's a napkin sketch to explain better:
    </p>

    <img
      alt="Stupid fucking knot that cramps my expression."
      src="./images/stupid_knot.png"
    />
    <figcaption>The Knot</figcaption>

    <p>
      There really is no one to blame for this mysterious malady of
      <button
        data-content="I was told that I ran into a wall when I was half the
height of a Stratocaster. I have no recollection of this. Perhaps that wall had
something to do with it."
      >
        mine</button
      >. From the time I was very young, my entire being has vehemently opposed
      interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I remember when I joined college it took me a good 6 months to speak to
      another student (my stolid exterior did nothing to help me). Conversing
      with people comes to me as naturally as conversing with
      <button
        data-content="Atleast I
know they like shelled peanuts. Wtf do people like? Complements? Attention? Who
knows? Would've been easier if I could just hand them candy or
something."
      >
        corvids</button
      >. The upside to my affliction was the independence that arose from an
      introversion inflicted necessity.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of this, as you can imagine, gets in the way of getting to know
      people. I swear if I had a dollar for everytime someone told me that I
      turned out to be nothing like what they had expected<button
        data-content="I'd have three
dollars."
      >
        ...
      </button>
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyways, coming down to the reason as to why this website exists: If you
      were to attempt conversing with me, depending on how familiar we are, what
      you'll mostly receive is an incoherent mess of words from my end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since all mental eloquence is thrown to the wind when it comes to talking
      to strangers, there was a need for a medium through which I could
      articulate. Hence this. This website is me attempting to articulate
      without having to talk, it's basically me saying "no man, I'm not an
      idiot" in a meta kinda way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course all of this could've been done through an extant medium such as
      Medium, but having my own website means I have my own execution
      environment (in your browser, thank you very much). Which means I can do
      stuff like hide easter eggs such as a hidden theme toggler or something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Had I had this earlier, stuff like this
      <a
        href="https://python.plainenglish.io/making-a-synth-with-python-oscillators-2cb8e68e9c3b"
        >series of posts on coding synths</a
      >
      would have been so much more cooler!
    </p>

    <p>
      As for what to expect? I honestly don't know, all I can say is, this most
      certainly isn't a dev blog. Yes, there may (at some point) be dev stuff on
      it, but I'm a
      <button
        data-content="Kind people at my current work place I say this
in jest, I'm an awesome engineer."
      >
        terrible engineer
      </button>
      so you're better off getting that sort of advice from someone else
      anyways.
    </p>

    <p>Hopefully this isn't my last post. ðŸ¤ž</p>
