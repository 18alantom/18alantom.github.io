    <h1>Misanthropy Thwarted</h1>
    <time datetime="2022-01-22">22nd January, 2022</time>

    <p>
      The place where I work when it's someone's birthday, a mail is sent out to
      the entire team informing them that it's this particular individual's
      birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of my childhood—the <i>woe be unto me</i> nature of
      which I won't get into—birthdays have never been a particularly joyous
      occasion for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      They often remind me of large swaths of normalcy absent from my life. Due
      to this, my preferred way of dealing with my birthday has been to not be
      aware that is is my birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      This obviously isn't possible due to the deluge of reminders, the majority
      of which are automated, such as the earlier mentioned email.
    </p>

    <h3 id="masterstroke-of-a-misanthrope">Masterstroke of a Misanthrope</h3>
    <p>
      Almost as soon as I became aware of this system, I set a reminder to go
      off one day before my birthday. This was to remind me to do something to
      prevent the email from being sent out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reminder did its job, I went and changed my birthdate on my
      company profile page.
    </p>
    <p>
      0000 rolled by and no email. Hell yeah, I thought, I've outsmarted the
      system, no one will ever come to know when I was born!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was awake for quite a long time, until 0400, not due to celebrations
      (obviously), but because I was stuck on some stupid Webpack error and
      couldn't go to bed until I'd solved it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="misanthrope-thwarted">Misanthrope Thwarted</h3>
    <p>
      When I woke, I was inundated with messages. My clever plan did not work
      out, how?! Turns out I had edited the incorrect record, and that the mail
      isn't sent to the person whose birthday it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      This in retrospect seems obvious but given my lack of experience with
      birthdays, it wasn't very obvious to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What surprised me was the number of people that wished me. Historically
      the number of <i>non-blood-related-humans</i> that wish me has been fewer
      than the
      <button
        data-content="No, I won't bother you with the actual number. I resort to
obscure relative units for a reason."
      >
        number of fingers
      </button>
      it takes to play the Smoke on the Water riff. This time though, number of
      people that wished me exceeded the digits on my hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      And I don't mean the
      <button
        data-content="This has always felt so incredibly
trite. A form a cheap social signalling, like 'Guys, I've wished this person, I
did my part'. Relatives wish me on family groups I'm absent from, and in
response my mother thanks them for the wishes in a way that implies that I
thanked them even though I was neither aware of the wishing nor the thanking.
Wtf kind of buffoonery is this? It's as if they're NPCs performing a routine. I
mean if you want to wish me, just wish me it's not like you don't have my
number."
      >
        half-assed message on the group
      </button>
      kinda wishing. I mean full-blown personal chat kinda wishing—absolutely
      unprecedented! Some of those who wished me, I had never even spoken to.
      This obviously made me think, as to why they would do such a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that I'm not some rockstar 10x dev in the company. I'm a
      fringe character who mostly elides himself from the company affairs, but
      rears his head once in a blue moon to assure those concerned that he's
      been diligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, this completely rules out
      <button
        data-content="Due to earlier mentioned
childhood, on experiencing positive social interactions, my mind always pitches
into cynical negatives. It starts peeling away at the layers of the interactions
(human comms can be analogized very nicely with the layered nature of computer
networks) and finding twisted explanations. This, I've surmised, is an erstwhile
social defence mechanism that of late just gets in the way. Nowadays I've to
exert considerable will to prevent that line of thought."
      >

      >. Maybe they felt obligated to wish me due to the company's social
      structure? It surely can't be 100% Jesus Christ certified
      <em>goodwill</em>, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      The only way of testing this would be if everyone got a reminder email
      while thinking that they are the only ones receiving the email. Obviously,
      the group, where wishes are sent out like a UDP datagram (you either get
      it or you don't), would have to be eliminated to prevent cross talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this experiment would have to be repeated multiple times, each with a
      different birthday person. This would beget a reasonably accurate
      <em>goodwill</em> metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since this silly experiment is equal parts unethical and unrealistic,
      one has to resort to heuristics. And so, I finally decided that people are
      nice.

    <p>
      I appreciate such moments because they remind me that I don't need to use
      the colors of my sub-optimal past to paint my future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way, I'm glad that I messed up my misanthropic masterstroke. The
      alleviation of asocial tendencies certainly doesn't arise from pushing
      people further away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, it probably requires being around emotionally stable,
      gregarious people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't a new realization, but it's nice to be reminded of it every
      once in a while. Acting in accordance with this realization is still
      incredibly difficult.
