        until verified by you—the reader. I just wanted to write something after

      Has any one else noticed that most claims of
      <i>"AGI in T minus 10 years"</i> are generally made, not by ML/DL
      engineers or researchers, but by Elon Musk and the philosophers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, notice there is nothing such as an AI engineer. This is just a bogus
      term used by people of the same ilk as the fungible folk fomenting non
      fungible

        data-content="Digital scarcity is an illusion, stop trying to hype it into

        tokens</button
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Years from now ML/DL folk are gonna be miffed by the fact that bogus
      people and charlatans have claimed the AI [<i>suffix</i>] titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not unlike—much to the dismay of Astronomers—bogus people and
      charlatans having claimed the term <i>Astrology</i>. A word that is
      supposed to mean <i>study of the stars</i>. Although, I do feel that once
      intergalactic space travel becomes the norm, bogus people and charlatans
      will cede the term <i>Astrology</i>. But then again, knowing bogus people
      and charlatans, they'll probably just claim that intergalactic space
      travel is fake. This is not unlike flat-earthers, who are either really
      good trolls or bafflingly stupid people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting back to the topic, this is not meant to be a dig at Nick Bostrom
      or something. I did enjoy

      the <i>paper-clip-maximization-bot</i>. But it does feel like most of
      these claims are just philosophers doing what they do best—exhausting all
      possible thoughts and ideas in some concept space. Also,
      <i>the paper-clip-maximization-bot</i> is a nonsense thought experiment,
      it's like saying what if you write a while loop but don't code in an exit
      condition.

      Until Andrej Karpathy or someone of the Andrej Karpathy type claims
      <button

      that AGI is ten years away we can all worry about aliens instead. But when
      they do, it would behoove all of us to start the construction of an

        data-content="We could

        air-gapped bunker</button
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine the year is 2030 and Elon Musk the philosophers have run out of AI
      related things to worry about, then what? Let me tell you what, AI winter
      is what.

      Again I'm not taking a dig at Elon Musk and the philosophers or something,
      in my free time I too like to think about the various ways an AGI would
      screw us over. But after having delved a bit into the engineering and
      research behind ML/DL, it feels like what Elon Musk and the philosophers
      fear is atleast one paradigm shift away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"Well why can't paradigm shifts take place in ten years?"</strong
      ><br />
      In 2012 the paradigm shift that allowed Neural Nets to decimate
      competition in the ImageNet challenge was not the software architecture.
      It was the
      <button
        data-content="And even then, Alex Krzhevsky and friends weren't the first to do
this, i.e. it was just a local paradigm shift"
      >
        use of GPUs
      </button>
      which allowed them to scale up NN architecture. Between LeNet (1988) and
      AlexNet (2012) there is no architectural paradigm shift. Heck the
      perceptron (precursor to the NN neurons) was invented in 1958.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>"You haven't answered the question..."</strong><br />Essentially
      there are limits to how many transistors one can fit in a limited area on
      a flat sheet of rock. So probably what needs to happen is someone tries to
      facilitate computation in three dimensions, in gray matter—not unlike the
      brain. This seems like a reasonable paradigm shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"And why can't that take place in ten years?"</strong
      ><br />Because we don't understand the brain? Shit... That too can take
      place in ten years, Elon Musk and the philosophers were right all along, I
      should probably start building my air-gapped bunker!

      Since I'm a broke developer—which may seem like an oxymoron, but not in
      India—I have decided to set up a patreon to fund my air-gapped bunker.
