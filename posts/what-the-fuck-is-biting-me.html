    <h1>What The Fuck Is Biting Me?</h1>
    <time datetime="2021-02-06">6th February, 2021</time>
    <p>
      Eleven something AM, woke up feeling like shit. My mental state mourning
      the cessation of an another failed attempt at good sleep.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-menace">The Menace</h3>
    <p>
      The night before, intermittently, I was being bit by insects I couldn't
      see, for hours I had been tossing and turning restlessly. Did I forget to
      wash and change the sheets? Maybe. Either way this made me aware that I've
      been caged by a sort of complacency. Fuck me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insects were probably in my mind, perhaps the side effect of being
      confined. Although, it was a sort of voluntary exile, I had no reason to
      not be confined. The outside didn't need me, and the inside was less
      scary. And then someone started a lockdown. Now there was no out. But as a
      disconnected node in the graph of society, I started feeling even more
      free. Now it was just my invisible insects and me. A match seemingly made
      for and since eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuck that, I thought to myself. My generosity doesn't stray far from my
      species, the insects aren't gonna be living here rent free. Given the lack
      of society, the insects had become my first priority.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-plan">The Plan</h3>
    <p>
      Insecticide and disinfectant, a duo made in heaven. Spray the mattress to
      commit insecticide, then the sheets for all those that hide. What was the
      disinfectant for again? I don't remember, but there was a virus in the
      air, bacteria on the bed. Maybe the ethanol in the can could help me deal
      with all that. I was aware of my susceptibility to ignorance and curiosity
      fueled combinations, but surviving stupidity is the quickest way to
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started the cleansing at thirteen something. An hour of meticulous
      spraying and two empty containers later: a poisoned mattress, and a
      disinfectant wet sheet. Let's wait and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was excited for the night. At two, roughly around the time when sleep
      strikes, I was ready with a stupid smile, to finally understand what
      people meant by 'sleep tight'. Regulator set to three, the perfect balance
      between noise and breeze, I was ready to descend into sleep. Alright, it's
      power down time, started my ritual, The Giver in my right hand; on the
      device, but without the blue light, books can't b read in the dark of the
      night.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-descent">The Descent</h3>
    <p>
      I started my descent, hypnagogia and allâ€¦ several minutes pass by, I'm
      still descending but this time like a penguin attempting flight off of the
      wrong side of a cliff. Curse this need for sleep, I thought; felt like I
      had wished for descent upon a monkey's paw. Once again, I could feel the
      invisible insects bite and crawl. Lights on, not a trace. I was convinced
      that the ninja like insects were confabulations from behind my face. Why
      do you do this to me brain? You have been driving me insane!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fed up of another set of occurrences effervescing from beneath my
      threshold of consciousness; being unable to impugn my hypothesis of
      psychosomatic occurrences, or corroborate the cause of this effect, I
      finally gave up and relegated my purpose to the vanquishing of more
      urgent, primal needs. After an hour or so of that, I applied for another
      attempt at sleep. This time the insects didn't bother me. I think I may
      have even dreamed, but either way woke up as usual feeling bleak.
    </p>
    <h3 id="the-end">The End</h3>
    <p>
      Days have passed post my futile expedition to rid my life of the insects.
      I have since then tried various experiments with different sheets and
      mattresses, all to no avail. The frequency has decreased. The congregation
      of uncountable invisible insects these days seldom seek sojourn on my
      sleeping body. But when they do, they wreak havoc on my psyche. Their
      occurrences have no humanly discernible pattern. I live in perpetual hope
      that some esoteric knowledge of the future will grant me root access to
      kill these internal amok run processes.
