      <a href="https://github.com/18alantom/strawberry">Strawberry</a> was an
      experimental web framework I’d started writing to see if the niceties of
      modern web frameworks could be had without the kind of involvement they
      demanded—build steps, DSLs, tooling, heft, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      From
      <a href="https://18alantom.github.io/strawberry" rel="noreferrer"
        >Strawberry's website</a
      >:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I wanted to write a simple website.</p>
      <p>
        I restrained myself from using the usual frontend frameworks; for my
        purpose, their murder of dependencies felt like gross computational
        opulence.
      </p>
      <p>
        These previously, on annual re-visitation, instead of showing me my
        website after an innocuous yarn build, have sprawled my terminal with
        scary red text; portent of wasted hours.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The <em>simple website</em> refers to
      <a href="https://18alan.space/">18alan.space</a>, which previously was
      written using Gatsby (React), TypeScript, GraphQL etc. I remember opening
      the repo to write a post after a long gap and noticing that everything was
      unnecessarily complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were 43 TypeScript files, weird GraphQL queries for fetching images
      into blog posts,
      <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MDX</a>, and
      other such inelegant warts. Considering my website was just a handful of
      blog posts, it all felt deeply stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in hindsight, a junior-developerism where one feels impelled to
      shoehorn the latest tech-stack being peddled by the
      <a

        data-content='Another junior-developerism is announcing the initialism

        that is bolstered by use of said stack.'

        tech literacy</button
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reaction to this was rewriting my website using plain HTML, CSS, JS. No
      React, no TypeScript, no GraphQL. It was a silent rebellion of sorts. But
      I needed to add some dynamic interaction to it, and regular JavaScript
      felt a bit cumbersome. This lead to me making Strawberry.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-it-stopped">Why it stopped</h3>
    <p>
      A few things happened. I ended up just using regular JavaScript in my
      website—ironically even Strawberry felt like an overkill. And not much
      later, my work shifted away from
      <a href="https://github.com/frappe/books" rel="noreferrer"
        >Frappe Books</a
      >
      (an Electron app) to
      <a href="https://github.com/frappe/press" rel="noreferrer"
        >Frappe Cloud</a
      >
      (a hosting platform).
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a switch I made specifically to move away from webdev to gain some
      competence in other aspects of software development. This put significant
      distance between me and frontend development. I wrote close to no
      JavaScript in that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the next non-work project I did—<a
        href="https://github.com/18alantom/fex"
        rel="noreferrer"
        >fex</a
      >
      a CLI file-explorer in Zig—had nothing to do with webdev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in mid 2024, I got back into photography and wanted to showcase the
      pictures I had captured. Unsplash, which I’d used earlier, felt weird on
      <button
        data-content="Unsplash makes money off of royalty-free images provided
        by photographers in exchange for 'exposure'."
      >
        reconsideration</button
      >. And Instagram, which also I’d used earlier, just felt
      <button
        data-content="Instagram was less about photography and more about
        harvesting attention for profit at the expense of societal degradation."
      >
        gross</button
      >. So I just decided to go with my own website.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that that showing pictures on a website isn’t as straight
      forward as slapping an <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> in your HTML and calling
      it a day. There is some sizable complexity involved. And so I was back to
      the problem that impelled me to make of Strawberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d started writing the
      <a href="../photos.html" target="_blank">photos</a> page in plain webdev.
      It didn’t feel tedious. I realized there was a certain amount of fluency I
      had accrued over the years, and so I didn’t find the need to use
      Strawberry.
    </p>
    <p>I had no use for Strawberry.</p>
    <h3 id="the-decision">The decision</h3>
    <p>Archiving Strawberry was a bittersweet decision to take.</p>
    <p>
      Working on Strawberry was a lot of fun. It was an inlet for excitement for
      when work had gotten stale. Coming up with solutions to handle different
      reactivity problems felt like fun puzzle solving. Designing the website,
      the
      <a
        href="https://www.pixilart.com/art/strawberry-sr27182e5bff14b"
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
        >logo</a
      >, all of it was quite rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the end of the day, I didn’t use it. Even though I felt it had
      potential, I didn’t have the need for it, and so the ever-imperative final
      push was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideas—manifested or otherwise—will wither away in the absence of their
      utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when I consider sinking time into a project, I end up wondering
      <em>how much do I need this to exist</em>, or
      <em>how much will I learn from doing this</em>, or more poignantly
      <button
        data-content="People who speak corporate call this “profit motive”."
      >
        <em>what will I gain from this</em></button
      >. This line of thought—of <em>finding the angle</em>—is antithetical to
      fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes an idea will take a firm and unrelenting
      <button
        data-content="Similar to the deluge of infatuation one feels when becoming fully aware of that certain someone."
      >
        grasp over my psyche</button
      >, and I’ll end up sinking a few weekends in an attempt to realize it. But
      eventually the grasp weakens, and my logical brain is invoked to
      <em>find the angle</em>—how can this project be pimped for personal
      profit?
    </p>
    <p>
      A
      <button data-content="Nearly two years since my last commit.">
        few days ago</button
      >, someone raised an issue on Strawberry’s repo and I got notified. I
      opened the repo. I looked at the project, the code. I got excited. I
      created a list of what to do next, and started with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I kept the editor aside, my mind drifted towards
      <em>finding the angle</em>. I couldn’t find one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world didn’t need Strawberry, and neither did I. For fun, there were
      already a handful of other things I wanted to dive into. Having this
      waiting to be picked up weighed on me in some strange way and impeded me
      from diving into those things. And so the decision was made.
